      "text": "Nibunkatsu is a compact split keyboard mainly designed for typing and programming. It was fully designed, engineered & planned out in only 7 days.\n\n Funded by Blueprint, a movement by Hack Club and AMD (yes, that AMD) to empower teenagers to build tech projects and actually bring them to life!"

    {
      "heading": "The Split Mechanism",
      "text": "Although Nibunkatsu is not an innovation in any realms, it's a very cool concept which I've been aching to try for a while!\n\nBoth halves run the ESP32-S3 MCU, and communicate together using a 3.5mm TRRS cable."
    },
    {
        "heading": "CAD Design",
        "text": "This project obliged me to try CAD designing for the first time ever. It looked intimidating at first, but once I got into it, it turned out to be quite straightforward. The case I made for Nibunkatsu is my first ever 3D design fully made by me. I'm proud of the results and feel this represents a significant milestone in my design journey."

    {
        "heading": "Other functionality",
        "text": "Each half has a distinct feature, the left side has a small 0.91' display with custom UI designed using LOPAKA.app, and the right side features a rotary knob. Both halves work together with layers which are toggleable using special keys on the thumbs."

    {
      "heading": "Open Source",
      "text": "Nibunkatsu One is completely open-source, available on my GitHub (link available on top). This includes:\n\n- Complete PCB schematics and layouts (made in EasyEDA)\n\n- 3D model files for the case (.3MF format)\n\n- The updated Circuit Python code that runs on my own personal build! Based on the KMK keyboard firmware framework"
