      "text": "<h3>A revolutionary mechanical keyboard</h3>\n\nBuilt from the ground up with a focus on modularity, ergonomics, and aesthetic appeal.\n\nKibodo One features magnetically attachable modules that allow users to customize their typing experience on the fly.\n\nThe design integrates a side-display, which shows the time, a live count of your words per minute, system information, and allows you to configure the keyboard without requiring an installed app on your PC!\n\n It was born from a highschool project together with a colleague, [𝔗𝔬𝔪𝔞𝔰 𝔐𝔞𝔯𝔱𝔦𝔫𝔢𝔷](https://github.com/tomii070).\n\nThis project was so good that we were selected to present it nationally alongside 15 other projects from across Portugal! Although we didn't win the contest, I loved every moment of the journey"

    {
      "heading": "Design Philosophy",
      "text": "Kibodo One represents my belief that peripherals should be extensions of the user, not constraints. Every decision - from the switch selection to the module attachment mechanism - prioritizes the user experience.\n\nThe modular design means you can swap components based on your task at the moment: gaming, coding or just typing. The integrated display transforms a functional component into a creative canvas, allowing users to express themselves through custom backgrounds and information displays, extending the PC's functionality."

      "text": "The true innovation of Kibodo One lies in its modular system.\n\nTo showcase the real-world functionality of modularity, we created Tenki One, the first module ever for Kibodo, a number pad powered by pogo pins and communicating via Bluetooth LE to Kibodo.\n\n Each module attaches magnetically to the side of the keyboard, creating a customizable peripheral ecosystem.\n\nHere are some future module ideas:\n\n- **Macro Pad Module**: A small numpad-style module for saving frequently used macros\n\n- **Media Control Module**: Dedicated controls for volume, play/pause, and track switching\n\n- **Game Mode Module**: Specialized buttons for gaming configurations and actions\n\n"

      "text": "PsychOS is the name I gave to the firmware that runs on Kibodo One. (noticed the pun?)\n\nEverything from key scanning to the UI display drawing, was developed by me (excepting the display driver and HID code handling).\n\nI developed it using the Arduino Framework, which is definitely **not ideal** for this kind of project, it was definitely easy on development on the begining, but when requiring higher level code I just kept hitting walls and limitations. Due to limitations in the Arduino framework, key reporting has some issues — ESP-IDF would improve this, but requires a full source code rewrite.\n\nI tried making the code as modular and accessible as possible, each part of the keyboard has it's own separate files for the FreeRTOS tasks, which are then all included and started from main.cpp.\n\nAnd yes, I did waste time developing a custom BLE communication protocol and the rotary enconder driver myself lol..."
