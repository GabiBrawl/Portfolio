      "heading": "What is Kibodo One?",
      "text": "Born from a highschool project, Kibodo One is a revolutionary mechanical keyboard built from the ground up with a focus on modularity, ergonomics, and aesthetic appeal. Unlike traditional keyboards, Kibodo One features magnetically attachable modules that allow users to customize their typing experience on the fly.\n\nThe crown jewel of the design is the integrated OLED side-display, which can show custom data, system information, and allows to configure everything on the keyboard without an app!"
    },
    {
      "heading": "Design Philosophy",
      "text": "Kibodo One represents my belief that peripherals should be extensions of the user, not constraints. Every decision—from switch selection to module design—prioritizes the user experience.\n\nThe modular design means you can swap components based on your current task: gaming, coding, writing, or just typing. The OLED display transforms a functional component into a creative canvas, allowing users to express themselves through custom animations and information displays."

    {
      "heading": "The Modular Ecosystem and Tenki One",
      "text": "The true innovation of Kibodo One lies in its modular system.\n\nTo showcase the real-world functionality of modularity, we created Tenki One, the first module ever for Kibodo, a number pad powered by pogo pins and communicating via Bluetooth LE to Kibodo.\n\n Each module attaches magnetically to the side of the keyboard, creating a customizable peripheral ecosystem. Some future module ideas:\n\n**Macro Pad Module**: A small numpad-style module for saving frequently used macros\n\n**Media Control Module**: Dedicated controls for volume, play/pause, and track switching\n\n**Game Mode Module**: Specialized buttons for gaming configurations and actions\n\n"

      "heading": "Open Source Commitment",
      "text": "Kibodo One is an open-source project, available on GitHub at https://github.com/PsychoDuckTech. This includes:\n\n- Complete PCB schematics and layouts (KiCad format)\n\n- 3D model files for the case (STEP format)\n\n- 100% custom self-developed firmware source code\n\nThe community is encouraged to fork, modify, and improve upon the design. Contributing designers receive credit and can share their modules with the ecosystem."
