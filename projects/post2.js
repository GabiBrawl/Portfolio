In an era where every interaction is tracked and monetized, LePlayer Music takes a stand: your listening habits should not be commodified. We're building a platform where users are in control of their data, artists earn fair compensation, and the listening experience is genuinely yours.`

Our GitHub repository contains the full source code, and we welcome pull requests, bug reports, and feature suggestions. The project is open source under the LGPL 2.1 license. THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT AND NOT YET PRODUCTION-READY.`
