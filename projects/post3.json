He has a recommendation list, that while comprehensive, it was hosted on a basic Linktree page that made it cumbersome to browse through products. Watching Axel's detailed thought videos on each item was also constantly requiring a manual tiktok search.\n\nThe interface felt cluttered and hard to navigate. I wanted a better way to explore their recommendations that would make the browsing experience more pleasant and organized. It's my way to help the Audio community without being much of a savvy myself."

I built a clean interface with:\n\n- Intuitive product categorization and filtering\n\n- Detailed product cards with specifications and reviews\n\n- Mobile-optimized layout design for better usability\n\n- Professional presentation that tries to match B_Media's brand as best as I can"

The improved user experience and presentation resonated with them, and they decided to add my platform alongside their official Linktree link!! :D\n\nIt's incredibly rewarding to see my work being appreciated by the community I built it for."
