      "heading": "About Nibunkatsu",
      "text": "Nibunkatsu is a split keyboard mainly designed for typing and programming. It was fully designed, engineered & planned out in only 7 days. Ordering and assemlby took part during the following weeks.\n\n The first iteration was funded by Blueprint, a movement by Hack Club and AMD (yes AMD) to empower teenagers to build tech projects and actually bring them to life!"

    {
      "heading": "The Split Mechanism",
      "text": "Although Nibunkatsu is not an innovation in any realms, it's a very cool concept which I've been aching to try for a while!\n\nBoth halves run on the ESP32-S3 MCU, and communicate together ~~using a 3.5mm TRRS cable~~ by ESP-NOW. The original plan for communicating through the TRRS cable was scrapped due to having chosen an incorrect female connector, supporting only a TRS connection."

    {
      "heading": "CAD Design",
      "text": "This project obliged me to try CAD designing for the first time ever. It looked intimidating at first, but once I got into it, it turned out to be quite straightforward. The case I made for Nibunkatsu is my first ever 3D design fully made by me. I'm proud of the results and feel this represents a significant milestone in my design journey."

    {
      "heading": "Other functionality",
      "text": "Each half has a distinct feature, the left side has a small 0.91' display with custom UI designed using LOPAKA.app, and the right side features a rotary knob. Both halves work together with layers which are toggleable using special keys on the thumbs."
