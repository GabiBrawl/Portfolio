He has a recommendation list, that while comprehensive, it was hosted on a basic Linktree page that made it cumbersome to browse through products. Watching Axel's detailed thought videos on each item was also constantly requiring a manual tiktok search.\n\nThe interface felt cluttered and hard to navigate. I wanted a better way to explore their recommendations that would make the browsing experience more pleasant and organized. It's my way to help the Audio community without being much of a savvy myself."
